# Data Science Algorithms in a Week
This is the code repository for [Data Science Algorithms in a Week](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/data-science-algorithms-week?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781787284586), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will address the problems related to accurate and efficient data classification and prediction. Over the course of 7 days, you will be introduced to seven algorithms, along with exercises that will help you learn different aspects of machine learning. You will see how to pre-cluster your data to optimize and classify it for large datasets. You will then find out how to predict data based on the existing trends in your datasets.
